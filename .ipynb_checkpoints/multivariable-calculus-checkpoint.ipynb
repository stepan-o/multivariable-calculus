Locating a point that sits in a 3-D space requires three numbers called **coordinates**. The vector whose tip sits at the point can also be described with these same three numbers."

    "**Spheres** in $n$ dimensions are characterized by a radius. A sphere consists of all points at a fixed distance from a given center. The circle is the lowest dimensional sphere familiar to you. If it has radius $r$, its area is $\\pi r^2$ Also, the sphere in 3D has volume $\\frac{4} {3} \\pi r^3$ if it has radius $r$.\n",

    "Arguing by analogy, the pattern set by the circle and the 3D sphere seems to indicate that the **volume is proportional to $r^n$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove this requires use of **multiple integrals**, a tool we haven't yet added to our toolbox. We can, however, argue roughly this way: the radius has units of length. It is in fact the only characteristic about a sphere that has such units. Volume in $n$ dimensions, on the other hand, has units $(\\text{length})^n$ (Think about square meter as a unit of area and cubic meter as a unit of volume, for example.) Since the radius is the only quantity carrying the unit of length, it stands to reason just based on unit analysis that\n",
